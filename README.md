2Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a systematic application of engineering, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
It is the process of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software systems.
Traditional programming does not allow room for the system to adapt and work independently while software engineering allows room for the system to learn and adapt independently.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
a) Requirements: Includes gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b) Design: Creating the software architecture and user interface.
c) Implementation: Writing the code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d) Testing: Conducting vaious tests to ensure the software meets quality.
e) Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
f) Maintenance: Providieng ongoing support and enhancement to the software after deployment.gi
Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change
Waterfall- Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile uses incremental approach while waterfall uses sequential approach, the key difference is the approach in which they are used.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 

Requirements engineering is the process of documenting, and maintaining reuirements in the engineering design process.
The process involves gathering, analyzing, specifying and managing requirements for a product system or service. It is accurate and effective

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Is an engineering concept that advocates for designing software as independent, cohesive, and loosely coupled units.
Improved maintainability
Increased scalability
Clear Interfaces

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing tests individual units of code,
Integration testing tests how multiple units of code work together,
System testing tests the complete software system, Acceptance testing tests the software from the user's perspective.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

They are software tools that track and manage changes to code, documentation, and other project files over time, allowing developers to collaborate effectively and revert changes as needed.

They are important because they bring collaboration with other developers writing the same code not to overwrite.,
Version control
Versions: Git-supports merging, branching
          Azure- Offers item tracking, source code analysis.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is responsible for the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

 Refers to the process of updating, modifying, and repairing existing software systems to keep them operational, compliant, and performant after their initial deployment.

 corrective maintenance - fixes bugs and resolve defects of software.
 adaptive maintenance - modify software to meet changing reuirements.
 preventive maintenance - Identify and resolve potential issues.

 It is essential because: it Fixes Errors and Improves Reliability, Meets Changing Requirements, Enhances Performance and User Experience, Protects Against Vulnerabilities.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Security and privacy
Accountability for changes
Bias mitigation
Respect for user Rights.

They can be adhered by Following ethical codes,
Education and training.
Engage in ethical reflection.
Foster culture of ethics.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
